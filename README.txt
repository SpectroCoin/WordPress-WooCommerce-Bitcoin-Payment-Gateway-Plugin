== Installation ==

1. Install WooCommerce plugin and configure your store (if you haven't done so already - http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

2. Download SpectroCoin plugin or upload SpectroCoin plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. From Wordpress admin dashboard, navigate to **Plugins** -> **Add New** -> **Upload Plugin**. -> Upload the `spectrocoin.zip` file.

4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress dashboard -> Plugins -> Activate.
When page reloads click on "Settings".

5. Enter your Client ID, Client Secret, and Project ID (see How to get API credentials below).

== How to get API credentials ==

1. **Sign up** for a SpectroCoin Account.

2. **Log in** to your SpectroCoin account.

3. On the dashboard, locate the **Business** tab and click on it.

4. Click on **New project** and fill in the project details.

5. Submit the project and copy the "Project ID".

6. Navigate to **Settings** -> **API** and create a new API by providing an API name. Select the following scope groups:
   - "View merchant preorders"
   - "Create merchant preorders"
   - "View merchant orders"
   - "Create merchant orders"
   - "Cancel merchant orders"

7. Copy and store the Client ID and Client Secret securely.

== Testing & Callbacks ==

Order callbacks notify your server when an orderâ€™s status transitions to PAID, EXPIRED, or FAILED.

1. Enable **Test Mode** in your SpectroCoin project settings.

2. Simulate payment statuses:
   - **PAID**: Updates the order as **Completed**.
   - **EXPIRED**: Updates the order as **Failed**.

3. Ensure your `callbackUrl` is publicly accessible (local servers like `localhost` will not work).

4. Check the **Order History** and callback logs on SpectroCoin to verify callback success.

== Debugging ==

For troubleshooting, navigate to **WooCommerce** -> **Status** -> **Logs** and check the **plugin-spectrocoin** log file. If additional support is needed, contact SpectroCoin and provide the log details.
